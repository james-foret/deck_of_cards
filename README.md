A simple Java 25 class to build on:
===============================================
1. This repo is a work in progress, and meant to be a template to work off of for simulating a deck of classic playing cards.
2. I expect to maintain it and add to it over time, so let me know if you'd like to point out a way to improve it, or make a suggestion for additional features. 
3. I chose Java becuase it is verbose and widely known... I hope others may find use in adapting this class to their needs when building card games. 
4. Commments, proper docs, and  more features incoming!
